Professor Jing Shu received his bachelor's degree in physics from Peking University in 2003 and his Ph.D. degree in 2008 from the University of Chicago under Professor Carlos Wagner. He was a project researcher from 2008-2011 in Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU) and a European Research Council fellow in Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA) from 2011-2012. In 2012, he joined the Institute of Theoretical Physics(ITP), the Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS) as an associate professor, and became a full professor in 2015. Now he is also the vice director of Peng Huanwu Innovation Research Center for Theoretical Physics. He received the OCPA “Achievements in Asia Award” (2019) and the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (2020).
